    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Kazakhstan, landlocked country of Central Asia. It is bounded on the northwest and north by Russia, on the east by China, and on the south by Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, the Aral Sea, and Turkmenistan; the Caspian Sea bounds Kazakhstan to the southwest. Kazakhstan is the largest country in Central Asia and the ninth largest in the world. Between its most distant points, Kazakhstan measures about 1,820 miles (2,930 kilometres) east to west and 960 miles north to south. While Kazakhstan was not considered by authorities in the former Soviet Union to be a part of Central Asia, it does have physical and cultural geographic characteristics similar to those of the other Central Asian countries. The capital is Astana (formerly Nur-Sultan, Aqmola, and Tselinograd), in the north-central part of the country. Kazakhstan, formerly a constituent (union) republic of the U.S.S.R., declared independence on December 16, 1991.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
        Kazakhstan’s great mineral resources and arable lands have long aroused the envy of outsiders, and the resulting exploitation has generated environmental and political problems. The forced settlement of the nomadic Kazakhs in the Soviet period, combined with large-scale Slavic in-migration, strikingly altered the Kazakh way of life and led to considerable settlement and urbanization in Kazakhstan. The Kazakhs’ traditional customs uneasily coexist alongside incursions of the modern world.

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Kazakhstan's terrain consists of diverse geographical features. Lowlands cover one-third of the country, hilly plateaus and plains make up nearly half, and low mountainous regions account for about one-fifth. The highest peak, Mount Khan-Tengri (6,995 meters), lies in the Tien Shan range on the Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan-China border. The western and southwestern areas feature the Caspian Depression, Ustyurt Plateau, and Tupqaraghan Peninsula. The country also has several deserts, including the Greater Barsuki, Aral Karakum, Betpaqdala, Muyunkum, and Kyzylkum, with sparse vegetation supported by groundwater. Central Kazakhstan has salt lake depressions, while northern and eastern regions contain mountains such as the Altai, Chingiz-Tau, Tarbagatay, and Dzungarian Alatau ranges. The Tien Shan mountains dominate the southern border.

    <h2 class="text-center text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">Climate</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Kazakhstan’s climate is sharply continental, and hot summers alternate with equally extreme winters, especially in the plains and valleys. Temperatures fluctuate widely, with great variations between subregions. Average January temperatures in northern and central regions range from −2 to 3 °F (−19 to −16 °C); in the south, temperatures are milder, ranging from 23 to 29 °F (−5 to −1.4 °C). Average July temperatures in the north reach 68 °F (20 °C), but in the south they rise to 84 °F (29 °C). Temperature extremes of −49 °F (−45 °C) and 113 °F (45 °C) have been recorded. Light precipitation falls, ranging from 8 to 12 inches (200 to 300 millimetres) annually in the northern and central regions to 16 or 20 inches in the southern mountain valleys.

    <h3 class="text-center text-2xl font-semilight text-gray-700 mb-4 italic">Ethnic Group</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Fewer than one-fifth of the more than eight million ethnic Kazakhs live outside Kazakhstan, mainly in Uzbekistan and Russia. During the 19th century about 400,000 Russians flooded into Kazakhstan, and these were supplemented by about 1,000,000 Slavs, Germans, Jews, and others who immigrated to the region during the first third of the 20th century. The immigrants crowded Kazakhs off the best pastures and watered lands, rendering many tribes destitute. Another large influx of Slavs occurred from 1954 to 1956 as a result of the Virgin and Idle Lands project, initiated by the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, himself a Slav. This project drew thousands of Russians and Ukrainians into the rich agricultural lands of northern Kazakhstan. By 1989, however, Kazakhs slightly outnumbered Russians.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
        In the early years of independence, significant numbers of ethnic Russians in Kazakhstan emigrated to Russia. This emigration, along with a return to the country of ethnic Kazakhs, changed the demographic makeup of Kazakhstan: by the mid-1990s the Kazakh proportion was approaching half the total population, while that for the Russians was closer to one-third.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
        The trend persisted into the 21st century, as the Kazakh population neared two-thirds of the country’s total population while the Russian community represented just over one-fifth. Other ethnic groups in Kazakhstan include Uzbeks, Uighurs, and Tajiks, along with Ukrainians, Germans, Tatars, and Koreans.

    <h2 class="text-center text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">Language</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Kazakhs speak a Turkic language of the Northwest or Kipchak (Qipchaq) group. Russian, an official language, functions widely alongside Kazakh, which is the state language. Russian is the most widely understood language in the country.

    <h2 class="text-center text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">Religion</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Kazakhs are traditionally Muslim, but their adherence was informal during their nomadic past. Religious education became more structured when they settled in towns like Sterlitamak and Bukhara, where young Kazakhs studied in Muslim schools. This led to a more urban-style Islamic identity before Soviet rule. From the 1920s onward, Soviet authorities suppressed religious practices until Kazakhstan gained independence. Since then, religious freedom has been restored. Additionally, about one-fourth of the population follows Eastern Orthodoxy.

    <h2 class="text-center text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">Economy</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Kazakhstan possesses abundant natural resources. Its major exports include agricultural products, raw materials, chemical products, and manufactured goods. Privatization of state-owned industries was undertaken during the 1990s. In 1994 Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan formed an economic union, later joined in 1998 by Tajikistan, that enabled free movement of labour and capital among the countries and established coordinated economic policies. The union gradually gave way to what became the Eurasian Economic Union, consisting of Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan.

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Among the most important minerals are copper in the central areas and in Aqtöbe (Aktyubinsk) province; lead, zinc, and silver in the Rūdnyy Altai area and the Dzungarian Alatau and Qarataū (Karatau) spurs; tungsten and tin in the Kolbin Ridge and southern Altai; chromite, nickel, and cobalt in the Mugozhar Hills; titanium, manganese, and antimony in the central regions; vanadium in the south; and gold in the north and east. Processing facilities at Aqtaū produce large quantities of uranium mined in the Mangghyshlaq area. Much iron ore comes from Qaraghandy and Qostanay (Kustanay), and coal from the Qaraghandy, Torghay (Turgay), Ekibastuz, and Maykuben basins. In 1993 Kazakhstan finalized a contract with the Chevron Corporation to exploit the reserves of the Tengiz oil field, one of the world’s largest. In the mid-1990s agreements also were sought with foreign investors for the development of oil and natural gas from the Tengiz, Zhusan, Temir, and Kasashyganak wells. The profitability of such ventures rested principally on the establishment of new pipelines.

    		<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
    			Farming occupies some one-fifth of the labour force, largely the Kazakh portion plus the Slavic wheat farmers of northern Kazakhstan. Kazakhs raise sheep, goats, cattle, and swine. The country produces cereal crops, potatoes, vegetables, melons and other fruits, sugar beets, and rice, as well as fodder and industrial crops. Nuclear contamination of soils near Semey the result of Soviet weapons testing has hindered agricultural development in the northeast.

    		<h4 class="text-center text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">Industry</h4>
    		<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
    			Industry constitutes a prominent sector of the Kazakh economy, but it employs fewer than one-tenth of the indigenous Kazakhs. Manufacturing industries employing primarily Russian and Ukrainian workers produce cast iron, rolled steel, cement, chemical fertilizer, and consumer goods. Plants in Temirtaū and Qaraghandy produce steel. The country, with its nonferrous metallurgy concentrated in the east, is a major lead and copper producer. Kazakhstan’s fuel production has increased with the extraction of coal from the Qaraghandy and Ekibastuz basins.

Imports include machinery, metal and chemical products, and foodstuffs. Russia and China are its main sources of imports.
